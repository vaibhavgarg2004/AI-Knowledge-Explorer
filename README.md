# 🤖 AI Multi-Provider Chatbot

A smart, conversational AI chatbot built using Streamlit that integrates local document retrieval (RAG) and real-time web search (via SerpAPI). Powered by LLaMA3 via GROQ, this assistant provides accurate and context-aware answers for general knowledge, uploaded documents, and live queries.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally  

### ⚠️ Note for Windows Users

This project uses **ChromaDB**, which requires **SQLite ≥ 3.35.0**. Most Linux environments (like Streamlit Cloud) are patched using `pysqlite3-binary`, but:

- **`pysqlite3-binary` does NOT install on Windows**.
- If you're on Windows and the app works, your system SQLite is likely already up-to-date.
- If you encounter a `sqlite3` version error, please [manually install SQLite ≥ 3.35.0](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and ensure it's on your system PATH.

> **Do not install `pysqlite3-binary` on Windows** — it's only meant for Linux deployments (e.g., Streamlit Cloud).

### Prerequisites:  
- Python 3.8+

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavgarg2004/AI-Multi-Provider-Chatbot.git
   cd AI-Multi-Provider-Chatbot
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:   
   ```commandline
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Add GROQ credentials in a .env file inside the app/ directory**:
    ```text
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
    GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
    SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
    CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR=./chroma_db
    EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   ```
4. **Run the Streamlit app**:   
   ```commandline
    streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Document Retrieval (RAG)**  
   - Users upload documents which are chunked and indexed in **ChromaDB**.  
   - Queries are matched with top-K relevant chunks using embeddings.  
   - If similarity scores are below a set threshold, the chatbot can optionally fall back to web search. 

2. **Web Search Fallback**  
   - **SerpAPI** is used to retrieve live search snippets for queries not found in local documents.    

3. **LLM Interaction**
   - Context from both RAG and Web Search is sent to **LLaMA-3 via GROQ**.  
   - Supports **Detailed** or **Concise** responses based on user-selected preferences.  

4. **Dynamic Response Generation**
   - Combines document context, web snippets, and general LLM knowledge.  
   - Generates accurate, context-aware answers, even for multi-part or complex queries.
